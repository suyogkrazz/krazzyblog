## Hi, Iâ€™m Suyog. Nice to meet you.

**In Summary:** I turn **Coffee** into **Code**.

Since beginning my journey as a freelance developer nearly 6 years ago, I've done remote work for agencies, co-founded PineSoft and grew it to be a successful software consulting firm prior to leaving, and worked with talented people to engineer awesome products for both consumer and business usage. I'm quietly confident, naturally curious, and perpetually working on improving my chops one design problem at a time. I prefer to keep learning, continue challenging myself, and do interesting things that matter.
